## **Loan Eligibility Prediction**

This project investigates whether a loan applicant is likely to be eligible for a loan based on the information they provide. It includes data exploration, model development, documentation, and an environment setup that allows others to fully reproduce the analysis.

## **Contributors / Authors**

The project was created by Ali Boloor, Gurleen Kaur, Justin Mak, and Tanav Singh Bajaj. Each contributor worked on different parts of the repository through their individual feature branches, including data exploration, commentary, model training, and project documentation.

## **Project Summary**

At a high level, this project provides a complete workflow for building a loan eligibility classifier. The work begins with loading the main dataset located in the data folder. From there, exploratory analysis is performed to understand trends and relationships within the data. A logistic regression model is then trained to predict eligibility and the final trained model is saved in the models folder. Supporting scripts for EDA, data fetching, and model training are located in the scripts directory, while two Jupyter notebooks document the main exploratory and modelling workflow. This repository also includes documentation files, licensing information, and a reproducible environment file.

## **How to Run the Data Analysis**

To run the analysis, first set up the computational environment using the environment file included in the repository. After activating the environment, the user can open and run the notebooks in the root directory, or they can execute the Python scripts in the scripts folder to perform tasks such as exploratory data analysis or model training. The repository is structured so that anyone with the correct environment can follow the workflow from data loading all the way to model output.

## **Dependencies Needed to Run the Analysis**

All dependencies required to reproduce the analysis are specified in the environment.yml file at the root of the project. These include the necessary Python packages used for data loading, cleaning, visualization, analysis, and modelling. Installing and activating this environment ensures that users will have the correct versions of all packages used in this project.
